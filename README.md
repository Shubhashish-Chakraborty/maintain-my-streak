# Maintain My GitHub Streak
## This repository is dedicated to helping me maintain my GitHub contribution streak on busy days, the days when im unable to code/push!

### Sometimes life gets busy, and it's hard to find time for a full coding session. This simple workflow allows me to make a quick commit to keep the green squares coming!, there's nothing wrong in it right ðŸ˜„

## How it works

- This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that can be manually triggered. When run, it:

- Checks out the latest code.

- Appends the current date and time to this README.md file.

- Commits and pushes the change.

- To run the workflow, go to the "Actions" tab, select "Maintain Streak", and click "Run workflow".
